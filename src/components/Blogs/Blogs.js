                <h2>What is context api?</h2>
                <p>Answer: The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to <em>prop drilling or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. </em>Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

                <h2>what is semantic tag</h2>
                <p>Answer: Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page. Text that is enclosed in the tag is immediately recognized by the browser as some type of coding language.
